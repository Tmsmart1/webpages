  <h2>About Tate Smart</h2>
  <hr />

    <p>My name is Tate Smart and I am a freshman in <em>Mechanical Engineering</em>.
      I am in <ins>Mechanical Engineering</ins> because it interests me the most.
      Hopefully, I will <strong>gradutate</strong> with a degree in 4 years and get to go to work.
      </p>
      <br />
    <p> A past job experience I had was at Lowes.
      I enjoyed working a Lowes becausse I got to drive the forklift.
      I was certified on the forklift and that is something I will have with me for my life.
